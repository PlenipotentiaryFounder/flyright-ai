# Backend Reconfiguration Log

## Current Backend Structure
- backend/
  - api/
    - views.py (contains user registration, login, conversation management, and Weaviate search)
  - views.py
  - urls.py
  - settings.py
  - backend/
    - urls.py
  - src/
    - routes/
      - gouge.ts

## Planned New Apps
1. users
2. profiles
3. chat
4. mockoral
5. gouge
6. flashcards
7. analytics
8. admin

## Step 1: Users and Profiles Separation

### Analysis
- Current user authentication and registration are handled in `backend/api/views.py`
- No separate profile functionality exists yet

### Planned Changes

#### Users App
1. Create `backend/users/` directory
2. Create the following files in `backend/users/`:
   - `__init__.py`
   - `models.py`
   - `views.py`
   - `serializers.py`
   - `urls.py`
3. Move user-related functionality from `backend/api/views.py` to `backend/users/views.py`:
   - `RegisterView`
   - `LoginView`
4. Create `UserSerializer` in `backend/users/serializers.py`
5. Set up URL patterns in `backend/users/urls.py`
6. Update `backend/urls.py` to include users app URLs

#### Profiles App
1. Create `backend/profiles/` directory
2. Create the following files in `backend/profiles/`:
   - `__init__.py`
   - `models.py`
   - `views.py`
   - `serializers.py`
   - `urls.py`
3. Create `Profile` model in `backend/profiles/models.py`
4. Create `ProfileView` in `backend/profiles/views.py`
5. Create `ProfileSerializer` in `backend/profiles/serializers.py`
6. Set up URL patterns in `backend/profiles/urls.py`
7. Update `backend/urls.py` to include profiles app URLs

### Potential Impacts
- User registration and login processes will be moved to the users app
- A new Profile model will be introduced, which may require database migrations
- Frontend components interacting with user data may need to be updated to use new API endpoints

## Tasks for Users App
- [x] Create users app directory
- [ ] Create __init__.py file
- [ ] Create models.py file (if custom user model is needed)
- [ ] Move user-related views from api/views.py to users/views.py
- [ ] Create serializers.py for user-related serializers
- [ ] Create urls.py for user-related URLs
- [ ] Update main urls.py to include users app URLs

## Tasks for Profiles App
- [x] Create profiles app directory
- [ ] Create __init__.py file
- [ ] Create models.py file and define Profile model
- [ ] Create views.py for profile-related views
- [ ] Create serializers.py for profile-related serializers

- [ ] Update main urls.py to include profiles app URLs

## Next Steps
1. Review the planned changes and ensure all necessary components are covered
2. Begin implementing the changes for the users app
3. Test user registration and login functionality after moving to the new app
4. Implement the profiles app and its associated functionality
5. Update any frontend components that interact with user or profile data
6. Perform necessary database migrations
7. Thoroughly test all changes to ensure no functionality is broken

## Notes
- Existing functionality should not be broken during this process
- All changes should be reversible and well-documented
- Dependencies between different parts of the backend must be preserved or updated
- Work incrementally and validate each change
