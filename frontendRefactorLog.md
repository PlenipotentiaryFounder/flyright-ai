# Frontend Refactor Log

## Step 1: Initial Codebase Analysis
- [x] Review existing directory structure
- [x] Document all existing components and their locations
- [x] Analyze App.tsx for routing setup
- [x] Identify potential shared components

### Findings:
1. Current Directory Structure:
   - src/components/pages/
     - GougePage.tsx
     - MockOralPage.tsx
     - RegisterPage.tsx
     - LoginPage.tsx
     - ProfilePage.tsx
     - ChatPage.tsx
     - FlashcardsPage.tsx
     - AnalyticsPage.tsx
   - src/admin/
     - components/
       - Dashboard.tsx
     - pages/
       - UserManagement.tsx
       - MockOralManagement.tsx
       - GougeManagement.tsx
       - FlashcardManagement.tsx
       - AnalyticsManagement.tsx
       - AdminLoginPage.tsx
     - services/
     - AdminLayout.tsx

2. Routing Setup (App.tsx):
   - Uses React Router for navigation
   - Main routes: /gouge, /mock-oral, /register, /login, /profile, /chat, /flashcards, /analytics
   - Admin routes: /admin/login, /admin/* (nested routes for admin dashboard)

3. Potential Shared Components:
   - Need to analyze individual page components to identify common elements

## Step 2: Proposed New Directory Structure
- [x] Design new directory structure based on features
- [ ] Await approval before proceeding with changes

Proposed Structure:

src/
├── components/
│   ├── common/         # For shared components (to be identified)
│   ├── chat/           # Chat-specific components
│   ├── flashcards/     # Flashcards-specific components
│   ├── mockOral/       # Mock Oral-specific components
│   ├── gouge/          # Gouge-specific components
│   ├── analytics/      # Analytics-specific components
│   └── forms/          # Reusable form components (if needed)
├── pages/              # Main pages for routing (RegisterPage, LoginPage, ProfilePage)
└── admin/              # Keep current admin structure

### Next Steps:
- [ ] Confirm this proposed structure
- [ ] If approved, begin incremental implementation of the new structure
- [ ] If changes are needed, revise the structure before proceeding

## Step 3: Validation of Current vs. Proposed Structure
- [x] Checked existing directories against the proposal
- [x] Identified components to move and any conflicts
- [x] Logged planned moves and refactor tasks

### Findings and Planned Actions:
1. Directories to create:
   - src/components/common/
   - src/components/chat/
   - src/components/flashcards/
   - src/components/mockOral/
   - src/components/gouge/
   - src/components/analytics/
   - src/components/forms/

2. Components to move:
   - Move GougePage.tsx from src/components/pages/ to src/components/gouge/
   - Move MockOralPage.tsx from src/components/pages/ to src/components/mockOral/

   - Move FlashcardsPage.tsx from src/components/pages/ to src/components/flashcards/
   - Move AnalyticsPage.tsx from src/components/pages/ to src/components/analytics/

3. Components to keep in src/pages/:
   - RegisterPage.tsx
   - LoginPage.tsx
   - ProfilePage.tsx

4. Admin structure:
   - Keep the current admin structure as it's already well-organized

5. Potential shared components to identify and extract:
   - Look for common UI elements, forms, or utility components within the pages to be moved
   - Create these in the src/components/common/ or src/components/forms/ directories as appropriate

Next Steps:
1. Begin incremental refactor by creating new directories
2. Move components one at a time, updating import paths as necessary
3. Identify and extract shared components during the refactoring process
4. Update App.tsx with new import paths after each move
5. Test functionality after each change

## Step 4: Incremental Refactor Execution (continued)
- [x] Created new directories under src/components/
- [x] Moved GougePage component to src/components/gouge/
- [x] Updated relevant import path in App.tsx
- [x] Resolved linter error for GougePage import
- [x] Test GougePage functionality
- [x] Move MockOralPage component to src/components/mockOral/
- [x] Update App.tsx with new import path for MockOralPage
- [ ] Test MockOralPage functionality
- [ ] Move ChatPage component to src/components/chat/
- [ ] Update App.tsx with new import path for ChatPage
- [ ] Test ChatPage functionality
- [ ] Repeat process for other components (FlashcardsPage, AnalyticsPage)
- [ ] Identify and extract shared components
- [ ] Update App.tsx with all new import paths
- [ ] Conduct thorough testing after all moves are complete
