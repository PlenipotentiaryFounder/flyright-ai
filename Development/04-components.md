# Components

The structure of our applicationâ€™s components is designed to be modular, reusable, and maintainable. Components are the building blocks of the user interface, and their design follows best practices to ensure ease of development, testing, and scalability.

## Component Structure

### 1. Atomic Design Principles
Our components follow the Atomic Design methodology, breaking down the UI into the following layers:
- **Atoms**: The smallest building blocks, such as buttons, input fields, and icons.
- **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms that form slightly more complex UI elements, such as form inputs with labels.
- **Organisms**: Larger components made up of molecules, such as navigation bars or user profile sections.
- **Templates**: High-level page structures that define layouts but are not tied to specific data.
- **Pages**: The complete pages that are rendered in the browser, containing specific data and logic to make the app functional.

### 2. Component Types
- **Presentational Components**: These are stateless or "dumb" components responsible for displaying UI elements based on the data they receive as props. They focus solely on the presentation of data and don't contain any business logic.
- **Container Components**: These components manage the application logic and handle API calls, state management, and business logic. They pass data down to presentational components as props. Container components connect to the global state via Redux.
- **Shared Components**: Commonly used components that are shared across various parts of the application. These are usually found in the common/ directory and include elements such as buttons, form fields, modals, etc.

### 3. Component Directory Structure
The component directory is organized to reflect a clear hierarchy and separation between shared components, pages, and feature-specific components.
