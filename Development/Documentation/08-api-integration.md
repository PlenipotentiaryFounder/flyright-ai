Navigation
The navigation system for our web application is built using React Router, a powerful library for managing routing and navigation in React applications. It allows for smooth transitions between pages, dynamic route handling, and provides full control over the navigation flow.

Key Concepts
1. Client-Side Routing with React Router
React Router allows us to handle navigation on the client side without needing a full page refresh. This results in faster navigation and a more seamless user experience.
Routes are defined within the application and mapped to different components, representing distinct pages or views.
2. Nested Routes
React Router supports nested routing, which means that parent routes can contain child routes, making it easy to manage complex page layouts and sub-navigation.
This structure is useful for managing sections of the app that share a common layout but display different content (e.g., user profile sections or dashboard pages).
3. Dynamic Routing
React Router enables the creation of dynamic routes using parameters (e.g., /profile/:userId). These parameters can be accessed in components to dynamically load content based on the URL.
This is particularly useful for loading user-specific or resource-specific content without hardcoding individual routes.
4. Protected Routes
Some routes in the application require the user to be authenticated. These protected routes are wrapped in logic that checks the user’s authentication state before allowing access.
If the user is not authenticated, they are redirected to a login page or shown an access-denied message.
Directory Structure
The navigation-related files and routes are organized as follows:

bash
Copy code
src/
├── navigation/
│   ├── AppRouter.tsx               # Main router for the application
│   ├── ProtectedRoute.tsx          # Higher-order component for protected routes
│   └── routes.ts                   # Route definitions and paths
Route Configuration
We use React Router’s BrowserRouter to handle the application's routing. The routes are defined in a centralized routes.ts file for clarity and scalability.

Example of Route Setup
tsx
Copy code
// src/navigation/AppRouter.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
import HomePage from '../components/pages/HomePage';
import ProfilePage from '../components/pages/ProfilePage';
import SettingsPage from '../components/pages/SettingsPage';
import NotFoundPage from '../components/pages/NotFoundPage';
import ProtectedRoute from './ProtectedRoute';

const AppRouter = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
        <Route path="/profile" element={<ProtectedRoute><ProfilePage /></ProtectedRoute>} />
        <Route path="/settings" element={<ProtectedRoute><SettingsPage /></ProtectedRoute>} />
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFoundPage />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default AppRouter;
Route Definitions
The routes.ts file can be used to store all route paths in one place, making it easy to reference and update routes across the application:

tsx
Copy code
// src/navigation/routes.ts
export const HOME = '/';
export const PROFILE = '/profile';
export const SETTINGS = '/settings';
Nested Routes Example
If you have sections within a page that require sub-navigation (e.g., different tabs in a user profile), you can easily nest routes within a parent component:

tsx
Copy code
// src/components/pages/ProfilePage.tsx
import { Outlet, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

const ProfilePage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <nav>
        <Link to="details">Profile Details</Link>
        <Link to="settings">Profile Settings</Link>
      </nav>
      <Outlet /> {/* Nested routes will render here */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ProfilePage;
Then, in the main router, nest these routes under the /profile path:

tsx
Copy code
<Route path="/profile" element={<ProfilePage />}>
  <Route path="details" element={<ProfileDetails />} />
  <Route path="settings" element={<ProfileSettings />} />
</Route>
Protected Routes
To protect certain routes (like user profile or settings pages), we use a ProtectedRoute component. This component checks the authentication state before allowing the user to access the route.

tsx
Copy code
// src/navigation/ProtectedRoute.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { selectIsAuthenticated } from '../store/slices/authSlice';

const ProtectedRoute: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  const isAuthenticated = useSelector(selectIsAuthenticated);

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return <Navigate to="/" />;
  }

  return <>{children}</>;
};

export default ProtectedRoute;
This can be applied to any route where you want to restrict access:

tsx
Copy code
<Route path="/settings" element={<ProtectedRoute><SettingsPage /></ProtectedRoute>} />
Navigation Links
We use React Router’s Link component to handle internal navigation. This prevents full-page reloads and ensures that navigation is fast and seamless.

tsx
Copy code
// Example of navigation links
<nav>
  <Link to="/">Home</Link>
  <Link to="/profile">Profile</Link>
  <Link to="/settings">Settings</Link>
</nav>
Dynamic Routes Example
For pages that require dynamic content based on URL parameters (e.g., user profiles or resource details), we use dynamic route parameters in React Router.

tsx
Copy code
// src/components/pages/UserProfile.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

const UserProfile = () => {
  const { userId } = useParams(); // Extract the dynamic userId from the URL
  // Fetch user data based on the userId
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>User Profile for {userId}</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserProfile;
To configure this dynamic route:

tsx
Copy code
<Route path="/profile/:userId" element={<UserProfile />} />
Best Practices
Route Centralization: Store route paths in a central file (routes.ts) to avoid hardcoding paths throughout the app. This makes updating or refactoring routes easier.

Lazy Loading: For larger applications, use React’s lazy loading to load routes dynamically and improve performance:

tsx
Copy code
const HomePage = React.lazy(() => import('../components/pages/HomePage'));
404 Handling: Always provide a fallback route to handle 404 errors (i.e., routes that do not match any defined path):

tsx
Copy code
<Route path="*" element={<NotFoundPage />} />
Breadcrumbs: For deep or nested routes, consider implementing a breadcrumb navigation system to enhance user experience and provide better context.

Conclusion
Our navigation system, built with React Router, ensures efficient and flexible routing across the web application. By utilizing protected routes, dynamic routing, and nested routes, we provide a seamless and secure navigation experience for users. This approach ensures that the app remains scalable and maintainable as the navigation structure grows.
