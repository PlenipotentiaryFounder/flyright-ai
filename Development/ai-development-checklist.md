AI Development Checklist
This checklist is designed to guide AI assistants and the development team through the process of building the web application using React, Django, and Weaviate.

Project Setup
 Initialize project directory

Create a new directory for the project.
Navigate to the directory in the terminal.
 Set up version control

Initialize a Git repository: git init.
Create a .gitignore file and add files to ignore (e.g., node_modules, .env, __pycache__, etc.).
 Install core dependencies

Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/ and npm.
Install Python and Django: pip install django.
 Create initial file structure

Separate the project into frontend (React) and backend (Django).
Core Development
 Implement shared utilities
Create a shared or core directory for shared business logic, utilities, and services.
 Set up state management structure (Frontend)
Install Redux and Redux Toolkit: npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux.
Create a store/ directory and configure the Redux store.
 Set up API client
Install Axios for API requests: npm install axios.
Create an api/ directory in the frontend to manage API calls using Axios.
Add token handling for authentication in Axios interceptors.
Web Development (React)
 Set up React project
Create a new React project: npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript.
 Set up TypeScript
Ensure TypeScript support: npm install typescript @types/react @types/react-dom.
 Implement core components
Create a components/ directory and begin implementing reusable UI components.
 Set up web routing
Install React Router: npm install react-router-dom.
Create a navigation/ directory and define routes using React Router.
 Implement protected routes
Set up a ProtectedRoute component to guard authenticated routes.
Backend Development (Django)
 Set up Django project

Create a new Django project: django-admin startproject backend.
Set up a virtual environment and install required dependencies: pip install django djangorestframework.
 Create API endpoints with Django REST Framework

Create a new Django app for the API: python manage.py startapp api.
Define API views, serializers, and models.
 Set up CORS for API

Install CORS headers: pip install django-cors-headers.
Configure CORS in the Django settings.py file to allow API communication with the React frontend.
Weaviate Integration (AI)
 Add Weaviate Python client to Django
Install the Weaviate client: pip install weaviate-client.
 Implement Weaviate document querying
Create a services/ directory in the Django backend to handle document querying with Weaviate.
 Create search API endpoint in Django
Implement a search view that allows the frontend to query Weaviate through a Django API endpoint.
Testing
 Set up front-end testing environment

Install testing libraries: npm install jest @testing-library/react.
Create unit tests for React components using Jest and React Testing Library.
 Set up back-end testing environment

Set up Django’s testing framework using pytest or Django’s default TestCase classes.
 Write unit tests for core logic

Implement unit tests for utility functions and business logic on both the front-end and back-end.
 Write integration tests

Write integration tests for API endpoints, ensuring the back-end and front-end components work correctly together.
 End-to-End (E2E) testing

Install Cypress for end-to-end testing: npm install cypress.
Write E2E tests simulating user flows (e.g., login, profile updates).
Documentation
 Update README

Ensure the README provides an updated project overview, installation instructions, and technologies used.
 Document API endpoints

Document each API endpoint (method, path, request/response structure) for the development team and external consumers.
 Component and state management documentation

Add documentation for core React components and explain the state management flow with Redux.
Performance Optimization
 Code splitting and lazy loading

Implement dynamic imports for React components to enable code splitting: React.lazy().
Implement lazy loading for images and other assets to improve load times.
 Optimize back-end database queries

Use Django ORM methods like select_related and prefetch_related to optimize database access.
 Implement caching strategies

Add caching in Django for frequently accessed data (e.g., Redis or Django’s caching framework).
Deployment
 Set up build process for React (Web)

Configure Webpack for optimized production builds: npm run build.
 Set up back-end deployment

Configure deployment using a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean) with Django.
 Implement CI/CD pipeline

Use GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or similar for continuous integration and deployment. Automate testing and deployment for every push.
Notes:
Ensure all steps are checked off as completed.
Add additional steps for mobile development as needed when creating the separate repository for mobile.
This checklist reflects the updated development approach with React, Django, and Weaviate, ensuring alignment with the new technologies and optimizations. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
