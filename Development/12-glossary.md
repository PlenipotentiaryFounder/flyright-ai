Glossary
This glossary defines key terms, technologies, and concepts used throughout the project. It serves as a reference for developers and contributors to ensure clarity and consistency.

API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. In this project, APIs are used to enable communication between the React front-end and the Django back-end through HTTP requests.

Axios
A promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript used to make API requests from the React front-end. It simplifies sending asynchronous requests (e.g., GET, POST, PUT) and handling responses.

Back-End
The server-side of the application, responsible for processing requests, handling business logic, and interacting with databases. In this project, the back-end is built with Django and Django REST Framework.

BrowserRouter
A React Router component that manages client-side routing by mapping different URL paths to specific components in the application, enabling single-page application (SPA) behavior.

Caching
A technique for temporarily storing frequently accessed data in memory (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce load times and improve performance by avoiding repeated database queries or computations.

Celery
A distributed task queue used to run background jobs asynchronously. In Django, Celery can be used to handle tasks such as sending emails, processing large datasets, or handling scheduled jobs.

Code Splitting
A technique for breaking up the JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks to load only the code needed for the current page, improving initial load times and performance.

Component
In React, a reusable, self-contained piece of UI logic that can be used across different parts of the application. Components can be stateless (pure UI) or stateful (handling logic and data).

CSS-in-JS
A styling technique where CSS is written within JavaScript, scoped to individual components. In this project, styled-components is used for CSS-in-JS.

Django
A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. In this project, Django serves as the back-end framework, providing models, views, and templates for the application.

Django REST Framework (DRF)
An extension of Django that provides tools for building RESTful APIs. It allows developers to serialize data, handle HTTP requests, and create API views.

End-to-End (E2E) Testing
A testing methodology that simulates real user interactions with the application by testing the full flow from the front-end to the back-end. In this project, Cypress is used for E2E testing.

GZIP Compression
A method of compressing files (such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to reduce their size before sending them to the browser. GZIP compression improves performance by decreasing file transfer times.

JWT (JSON Web Token)
A compact, URL-safe token used for securely transmitting information between parties. In this project, JWTs are used for user authentication, storing the token on the client-side, and verifying it on subsequent requests.

Lazy Loading
A performance optimization technique that delays loading certain parts of the application, such as images or components, until they are needed. This reduces initial load times and improves the user experience.

LocalStorage
A web storage API that allows developers to store data on the user's browser persistently. In this project, localStorage is used to store JWT tokens for user authentication.

Middleware
Software that acts as a bridge between the front-end and back-end, processing requests and responses. In Django, middleware is used for tasks like authentication, logging, and session management.

Minification
The process of removing unnecessary characters (such as whitespace and comments) from code to reduce its size, which speeds up file transfers and improves performance. Tools like Terser are used to minify JavaScript in production builds.

Model (Django)
A Python class that represents the structure of a database table. In Django, models define the fields and behaviors of the data stored in the database.

Pagination
The process of dividing a dataset into smaller chunks (pages) to improve performance when displaying large amounts of data. Django’s Paginator class handles pagination on the back-end.

Protected Route
A route in the application that requires the user to be authenticated to access. If the user is not logged in, they are redirected to the login page. In React, ProtectedRoute is used to manage access to such routes.

React
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. React allows developers to create reusable components and manage the application state efficiently.

React Router
A library used in React applications to handle navigation and routing. It allows developers to define URL paths and map them to specific components, enabling client-side routing.

Redux
A predictable state management library for JavaScript applications. It helps manage the global state of the application, particularly for complex apps with many dynamic components.

Redux Toolkit
A utility library built on top of Redux that simplifies common tasks, such as defining reducers, actions, and slices of state. It helps reduce boilerplate code and makes state management more efficient.

REST (Representational State Transfer)
An architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations on resources.

Select Related / Prefetch Related
Django ORM methods that optimize database queries by fetching related data in fewer queries. select_related is used for single-valued relationships (foreign keys), and prefetch_related is used for many-valued relationships (many-to-many).

Service Worker
A script that runs in the background of a web browser and allows features like push notifications, background sync, and offline functionality. Service workers are often used to cache static assets to improve performance.

Session-Based Authentication
A method of managing user authentication where the server creates a session for each user and stores session data on the server side. Session cookies are sent with each request to verify the user’s identity.

Styled-Components
A library for styling React applications using the CSS-in-JS approach. It allows developers to write CSS directly within JavaScript components and supports theming and dynamic styling.

Thunk
A middleware in Redux that allows for handling asynchronous actions. Thunks are used to perform side effects like API calls and dispatch actions based on the result.

Unit Testing
A testing methodology that involves testing individual components or functions in isolation to verify that they work as expected. In this project, Jest is used for unit testing React components.

Webpack
A module bundler for JavaScript applications. Webpack bundles JavaScript, CSS, and other assets into a single output file and optimizes it for production. It supports features like code splitting, tree shaking, and minification.
